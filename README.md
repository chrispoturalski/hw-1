## Description

In this project we did not write any new code, but we did refracture code that was already existing. I had re-wrote current HTML and CSS work and cleaned up to condense the CSS Style Sheet.
We located the semantic HTML elements and restructed them, I added alternative text to the images, I made sure the heading elements fall in sequential order, and I corrected the title to appear as a legitimate website. In CSS, I was able to target class elements to condense the existing code and to eliminate repeat code, wherever possible. I commented on all the changes that I had completed so the owner of the code is able to know all of the changes I made and why.
I created a new repository within GIThub to track all of my changes and commits. I created a README file through the termianl and successfully uploaded to GIThub through push commands.
Lastly, I applied the code to be a function URL with no errors.
